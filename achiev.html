										<strong>Hardwarethon is a space where people from several professional backgrounds 
										(design, engineering, software, hardware, social sciences, art, among others) 
										build teams in order to develop high-impact technological solutions for society.</strong>
										Through an intensive training process, participants are prepared to develop, in 
										just 48 hours, a business model and a 100% functional prototype that responds to 
										a problem raised.
										</p>

										<span class="image left"><img src="images/HW_002.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<p>
										Our team proposed a technology addressing an application for development process 
										monitoring of coffee production in its natural environment. Te main purpose of this
										delivery was to apply concepts of several disciplines as UXUI design, psicology and 
										also electronic, material and programming science engineering.
										</p>

										<p>
										This application will help local farmers and agricultural sector in general, helping 
										local economy of small neigbourhoods in Central Valley in Costa Rica. The idea came out 
										from a mix of coffee-lovers, engineers and friends who love technology.
										The main event was joined by Tourism and Science-Tecnology Ministers of Costa Rica 
										during the awards ceremony.

											<h2><a name="link_02"></a>$22K COST REDUCTION FOR EQUIPMENT CALIBRATION PROCESS</h2>
											<h3>Winning Spirit Award</h3>
										</header>

										<span class="image left"><img src="images/BSCI_02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										
										<p>
										<strong>As we already know, one of the key points for a company's success is the efficiency 
										increase and cost reduction projects essentially in manufacture process-oriented 
										companies.</strong> To do this is highly needed keeping quality as main target since quality 
										assurance is non-negotiable even more in healthcare products. 
										</p>

										<p>
										During 2017, we aimed for a path that led us to this purpose without putting any 
										risk on the product making nor the process balance. The initial assessment showed up 
										some gaps at process level producing waste of effective time in calibration equipment 
										process.
										</p>

										<p>
										After identifying the main issues  the process had, we decided to improve the process 
										by researching new techniques using new technologies on the market that allowed us not 
										only improving efficiency but also taking care of the final quality in manufactured 
										products. The final deliver was reconized by the management board and I was mentioned by 
										the company's higher-ups.

											<p>
											<strong>New Lay-out implementation for Calibration Lab in CER1 facility
											Area in Hospira Costa Rica</strong> Spirit to provide better services to 
											customers.
											</p>

											<p>
											This project was intended to fulfill the necessity of re-layout due to 
											calibration laboratory expansion. At that time, Quality Management board 
											were purchasing high technology measurement equipment to reach the new company 
											requirements and we were called innovation team.
											</p>

											<p>
											The main target was to use properly the space within the lab so a 
											multidisciplinary team of Industrial, Electronic and Mechanic Engineers 
											plus job safety specialists, were working in the re-installation and 
											commisioning following Regulatory affairs of all the lab equipment.
											</p>
	
											<p>
											This project was done in two weeks and the final deliver was really helpful 
											to the Quality Assurement dept since a Medical Devices company must fulfil 
											the utmost demand traits in regulatory affair.
